Project-Euler-Solutions
=======================

A set of solutions I wrote for various project Euler problems, some are in C# others are written in Python. Most problems are solved using efficient algorithms, yet brute forced my way through a few  which I may resolve later on. Not all solutions are well documented but I'll make sure to do so gradually. Feel free fork and suggest better solutions, enjoy!
